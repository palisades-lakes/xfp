\index{Good writing|see{Set}}
Primary goal of writing, whether in a natural language (eg
English), mathematics, or a programming language, is communicating
an idea to the reader.
This is (perhaps) obvious for natural and mathematical language,
but not univerally accepted for programming languages.

\cite{Abelson1996,Halmos1958Finite,Halmos1970HowToWrite,spivak-1965}

('Literate' programming confuses stream of consciousness writing
with communication with other people.)

Express the idea completely enough, without excess.
and specify no more than
necessary --- the he/she problem.

Make it clear what you aren't making clear.
