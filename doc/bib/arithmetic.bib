uppercuts the other by lowercuts, are developed within a 
constructive framework. The first includes distances to arbitrary

operators. The intuitive meaning of comparing such quantities to 
ordinary real numbers is preserved. Difficulties with encompassing 
both kinds of numbers in a single system are considered."

abstract = "In this paper we investigate an extension to Vuillemin's work on continued fraction arithmetic [Vuillemin 87, Vuillemin 88, Vuillemin 90], that permits it to evaluate the standard statistical distribution functions. By this we mean: the normal distribution, the -distribution, the t-distribution, and, in particular, the F-distribution. The underlying representation of non-rational computable real numbers is also as continued fractions, in the style of Vuillemin. This permits arbitrary accuracy over a range of values. The number of terms of a continued fraction that are used by the implementation is dynamically controlled by the accuracy demanded of the final answer. The use of a modern lazy functional language - Haskell - has considerably eased the programming task. Two features are of note. Firstly, the type-class structure allows one to augment the varieties of numbers supported by the language. Secondly, the laziness inherent in the Haskell's semantics, makes it very straightforward to dynamically control the accuracy of the intermediate evaluations.",

epresentation of real numbers based on the infinite composition 
of linear fractional transformations (lft), equivalently the
 infinite product of matrices, with non-negative coefficients. 
 Any rational interval in the one point compactification of the 
 real line, represented by the unit circle S1, is expressed as 
 the image of the base interval [0, âˆž] under an lft. A 
 sequence of shrinking nested intervals is then represented 
 by an infinite product of matrices with integer coefficients 
 such that the first so-called sign matrix determines an interval 
 on which the real number lies. The subsequent so-called digit 
 matrices have non-negative integer coefficients and successively 
 refine that interval. Based on the classification of lft's 
 according to their conjugacy classes and their geometric 
 dynamics, we show that there is a canonical choice of four sign 
 matrices which are generated by rotation of S1 by Ï€/4.
  Furthermore, the ordinary signed digit representation of real 
  numbers in a given base induces a canonical choice of digit 
  matrices."

abstract="Given a set of non-intersecting (except at endpoints) line segments in the plane we want to compute their Voronoi diagram. Although there are several algorithms for this problem in the literature [Yap87, For87, CS89, BDS+92, KMM90] nobody claims to have a correct implementation. This is due to the fact that the algorithms presuppose exact arithmetic and that the Voronoi diagram of segments requires to compute with non-rational algebraic numbers. We report about a detailed study of the numerical precision required for evaluating the geometric test exactly and about first experimental experiences. More specifically, we improve the precision bound implied by classical root separation results by more than two orders of magnitude and we compare the implementation strategies suggested by our theoretical results.",
