Abstract:      Active, optical range imaging sensors collect
               three-dimensional coordinate data from object surfaces and can
               be useful in a wide variety of automation applications,
               including shape acquisition, bin picking, assembly,
               inspection, gaging, robot navigation, medical diagnosis, and
               cartography.  They are unique imaging devices in that the
               image data points explicitly represent scene surface geometry
               in a sampled form.  At least six different optical principles
               have been used to actively obtain range images: (1) radar, (2)
               triangulation, (3) moire, (4) holographic interferometry, (5)
               focusing, and (6) diffraction.  In this survey, the relative
               capabilities of different sensors and sensing methods are
               evaluated using a figure of merit based on range accuracy,
               depth of field, and image acquisition time.
