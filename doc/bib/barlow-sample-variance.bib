abstract = {We give an error analysis of an algorithm for computing 
the sample variance due to Chan, Golub, and LeVeque 
[The American Statistician 7 (1983), pp. 242--247]. 
It is shown that this algorithm is numerically stable. 
The algorithm computes the sample variance (and the sample mean) 
using just one pass through the sample data. It is amenable to 
pairwise summation and thus requires onlyO(logn) parallel steps.},
