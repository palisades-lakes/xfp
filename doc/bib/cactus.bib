abstract = "Algorithms for summation and dot product of floating-point numbers are presented which are fast in terms of measured computing time. We show that the computed results are as accurate as if computed in twice or AT-fold working precision, K ≥ 3. For twice the working precision our algorithms for summation and dot product are some 40% faster than the corresponding XBLAS routines while sharing similar error estimates. Our algorithms are widely applicable because they require only addition, subtraction, and multiplication of floating-point numbers in the same working precision as the given data. Higher precision is unnecessary, algorithms are straight loops without branch, and no access to mantissa or exponent is necessary. © 2005 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.",
