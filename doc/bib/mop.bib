the barycentric coordinates of a point is a measure over the boundary

boundary, with density increasing with increasing Gaussian curvature,
resulting in point masses (dirac delta functions) at isolated extrema.
The boundary of a convex polytope has zero Gaussian curvature except
at the extrema, so it's barycentric coordinates reduce to a finite sum.
Very neat.
\par
However, this requires the polytope to be strictly convex --
it won't work as a way to interpolate over degenerate polytopes,
for example, the terminal bins of a decision tree.

Abstract:      Active, optical range imaging sensors collect
               three-dimensional coordinate data from object surfaces and can
               be useful in a wide variety of automation applications,
               including shape acquisition, bin picking, assembly,
               inspection, gaging, robot navigation, medical diagnosis, and
               cartography.  They are unique imaging devices in that the
               image data points explicitly represent scene surface geometry
               in a sampled form.  At least six different optical principles
               have been used to actively obtain range images: (1) radar, (2)
               triangulation, (3) moire, (4) holographic interferometry, (5)
               focusing, and (6) diffraction.  In this survey, the relative
               capabilities of different sensors and sensing methods are
               evaluated using a figure of merit based on range accuracy,
               depth of field, and image acquisition time.
