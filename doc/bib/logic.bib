    abstract = {Reading, not to mention writing and texting,
     is a relatively recent invention, and hence it is believed 
     that a preliterate brain must adapt on the fly, so to speak,
      in learning how to process written words, rather than 
      being able to rely upon evolutionarily ancient 
      modifications of the visual system pathways. 
      Dehaene et al. (p. 1359, published online 11 November) 
      examined the neural response to a range of visual stimuli
      in three groups: illiterate adults, adults who learned
      to read as children, and adults who learned to read 
      as adults. Reading induced a greater facility
      in processing horizontally oriented stimuli 
      at early stages in the visual pathway 
      and was also associated with the appearance 
      of an area specialized for words. This gain
      of function appeared to occur 
      at a cost{\textemdash}the area in the temporal cortex 
      devoted to face processing shrank.
      Does literacy improve brain function? 
      Does it also entail losses? Using functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging, we measured brain responses 
      to spoken and written language, visual faces, houses, 
      tools, and checkers in adults of variable literacy 
      (10 were illiterate, 22 became literate as adults, 
      and 31 were literate in childhood). 
      As literacy enhanced the left fusiform activation evoked 
      by writing, it induced a small competition with faces 
      at this location, but also broadly enhanced visual responses 
      in fusiform and occipital cortex, extending to area V1. 
      Literacy also enhanced phonological activation to speech 
      in the planum temporale and afforded a top-down activation 
      of orthography from spoken inputs. Most changes occurred 
      even when literacy was acquired in adulthood, emphasizing 
      that both childhood and adult education can profoundly 
      refine cortical organization.},

Proofs and their representations by formal derivations are treated as principal objects of study, not as mere tools for analyzing the consequence relation. Though the paper is principally expository it also contains some material not developed in the literature. In particular, adequacy conditions on criteria for the identity of proofs (in ¬ß 1c), and a reformulation of G√∂deƒæs second theorem in terms of the notion of canonical representation (in ¬ß 1d); the use of normalization, instead of normal form, theorems for a direct proof of closure under Church's rule of the theory of species [in ¬ß 2a(ii)] and the useless-ness of bar recursive functionals for (functional) interpretations of systems containing Church's thesis [in ¬ß2b(iii)]; the use of ordinal structures in a quantifier-free formulation of transfinite induction (in ¬ß 3); the irrelevance of axioms of choice to the explicit realizability of existential theorems both for classical and for Heyting's logical rules (in ¬ß 4c) and some new uses of Heyting's rules for analyzing the indefinite cumulative hierarchy of sets (in ¬ß 4d); a semantics for equational calculi suitable when terms are interpreted as rules for computation [in Appl. Ia(iii)], and, above all, an analysis of formalist semantics and its relation to realizability interpretations (in App. Ic). A less technical account of the present point of view is in [21]."

@article{mathias2001strength,
  abstract = {Saunders Mac Lane has drawn attention many times, particularly in his book Mathematics: Form and Function, to the system \{ZBQC\} of set theory of which the axioms are Extensionality, Null Set, Pairing, Union, Infinity, Power Set, Restricted Separation, Foundation, and Choice, to which system, afforced by the principle, TCo, of Transitive Containment, we shall refer as MAC. His system is naturally related to systems derived from topos-theoretic notions concerning the category of sets, and is, as Mac Lane emphasises, one that is adequate for much of mathematics. In this paper we show that the consistency strength of Mac Lane's system is not increased by adding the axioms of Kripke‚ÄìPlatek set theory and even the Axiom of Constructibility to Mac Lane's axioms; our method requires a close study of Axiom H, which was proposed by Mitchell; we digress to apply these methods to subsystems of Zermelo set theory Z, and obtain an apparently new proof that Z is not finitely axiomatisable; we study Friedman's strengthening KPP+AC of KP+MAC, and the Forster‚ÄìKaye subsystem \{KF\} of MAC, and use forcing over ill-founded models and forcing to establish independence results concerning \{MAC\} and KPP; we show, again using ill-founded models, that KPP+V&#xa0;=&#xa0;L proves the consistency of KPP; turning to systems that are type-theoretic in spirit or in fact, we show by arguments of Coret and Boffa that \{KF\} proves a weak form of Stratified Collection, and that MAC+KP is a conservative extension of \{MAC\} for stratified sentences, from which we deduce that \{MAC\} proves a strong stratified version of KP; we analyse the known equiconsistency of \{MAC\} with the simple theory of types and give Lake's proof that an instance of Mathematical Induction is unprovable in Mac Lane's system; we study a simple set theoretic assertion‚Äînamely that there exists an infinite set of infinite sets, no two of which have the same cardinal‚Äîand use it to establish the failure of the full schema of Stratified Collection in Z; and we determine the point of failure of various other schemata in MAC. The paper closes with some philosophical remarks. },

abstract="Starting from the topological point of view a certain wide class of To-spaces is introduced having a very strong extension property for continuous functions with values in these spaces. It is then shown that all such spaces are complete lattices whose lattice structure determines the topology --- these are the continuous lattices --- and every such lattice has the extension property. With this foundation the lattices are studied in detail with respect to projections, subspaces, embeddings, and constructions such as products, sums, function spaces, and inverse limits. The main result of the paper is a proof that every topological space can be embedded in a continuous lattice which is homeomorphic (and isomorphic) to its own function space. The function algebra of such spaces provides mathematical models for the Church-Curry $\lambda$-calculus.",

Part I deals briefly with the thesis that category theory (or something like it) should provide the proper foundations of mathematics, in preference to current foundational schemes. An opposite view is argued here on the grounds that the notions of operation and collection are prior to all structural notions. However, no position is taken as to whether such are to be conceived extensionally or intensionally.",
