\label{sec:Zeroth_order_logic}

Classical zeroth-order (propositional) 
logic~\cite{iep:Propositional_logic,
wiki:Propositional_calculus,
wiki:Zeroth_order_logic}

Subtle difference sometimes between propositional
and zeroth-order logic 
(=binary truth functional propositional logic).

Formal system:
language with atomic symbols
and logical operators defining well-formed formulas,
and inference rules that a set of axiom formulas 
and return deduced formulas.
\begin{description}
\item[Atoms]  $A, B, \ldots P, Q, \ldots$, 
that may be asisgned values \textsf{true} or \textsf{false}.

\item[Operators] $\lnot P$, $P \wedge Q$, $P \vee Q$, 
$P \Rightarrow Q$, $P \Leftrightarrow Q$. 
Minimal set is $\lnot$ and 
any $2$ of  $\wedge, \vee, \Rightarrow$;
sufficient to define $2$ remaining operators.

\item[Propositions] (Well formed formulas)
Recursively: atoms and propostions combined with operators,
including parens for grouping: $(P \wedge Q) \Rightarrow R$.

\item[Inference rules] ${P \Rightarrow Q), P} \vdash Q$:
Takes a set of propositions (with truth assignments?)
and returns another proposition.
\end{description}

A variety of such formal languages.

Syntatic entailment: formula derived from set of axioms 
using inference rules ina fininte number of steps.

Semantic entailment: formula evaluates to \textsf{true}
under all possible truth assignements to variables
in axioms.

Issues are 
\begin{description}
\item[Soundness]
All syntactically entailed formulas
are semantically entailed, that is,
a sequence of inferences will never lead to a contradiction.

\item[Completeness] 
all semantically entailed formaulas 
are syntactically entailed, that is,
any statement which is consistent with the axioms under all 
possible truth assignements is derivable (somehow) using the 
inference rules.

\item[Truth values] Usually $\{\mathsf{true},\mathsf{false}\}$,
but more than $2$ values is possible.
\item[Domain of discourse] A set $\Set{D}$.
\item[Constants] $A,B,C, \ldots$ names for values in the
domain.
\item[Variables] $a,b,c, \ldots x,y,\dots$ taking on values in the
domain.~\cite{wiki:Free_variables_and_bound_variables}
\item[Equality] combine atoms and variables.
\item[Functions] combine atoms and variables.
\item[Quantifiers]   
$\exists x \in \Set{S}$, $\forall x \in \Set{S}$ 
(where $\Set{S} \subseteq \Set{D}$);
$\exists x$ means $\exists x \in \Set{D}$, 
and
$\forall x$ means $\forall x \in \Set{D}$) 
bind variables in
formulas.~\cite{wiki:Quantifier_logic}
More specialized quantifiers are possible:
$\exists \textrm{ a unique } x \in \Set{S}$
\item[Predicates] combine atoms and variables.

Prenex normal form (PNF):~\cite{wiki:Prenex_normal_form} 
\textit{prefix} containing all quantifiers 
followed by quantifier-free \textit{matrix}.

In classical logic, every wff has a prenex equivalent;
not true for intuitionistic logic.

Example:
$\forall x 
((\exists y\phi (y))
\lor 
((\exists z\psi (z))\rightarrow \rho (x)))$ is not prenex.
$\forall x\exists y\forall z
(\phi (y)\lor (\psi (z)\rightarrow \rho (x)))$ 
is equivalent prenex.

Cantor diagonal argument:
\hfill\break
$\OneToOne$ map between binary sequences ($2^{\mathbb{N}}$)
and $[0,1]\subset\mathbb{R}$
Does that need a proof?
What about finite sequences vs trailing $1$s? 
\hfill\break
Then assume existence of a $\OneToOne$  
map between $2^{\mathbb{N}}$s 
and $\mathbb{N}$,
without any explicit construction.
Construct an explict missing sequence 
for any candidate $\OneToOne$ map,
by flipping the $i$th bit in the $i$th sequence,
thus a contradiction?
So $\mathfrak{c} = \mathrm{card}(2^{\mathbb{N}}) 
= \mathrm{card}(\mathbb{R})$ must be greater than 
$\aleph_0 = \mathrm{card}(\mathbb{N})$. 
\hfill\break
Claim this can be extended to any set $\Set{S}$,
proving 
$\mathrm{card}(\Set{S}) < \mathrm{card}(2^{\Set{S}})$,
including 
$\mathrm{card}(\mathbb{R}) < \mathrm{card}(2^{\mathbb{R}})$?

How does all this play with 
the Hilbert hotel paradox?~\cite{wiki:Hilbert_hotel}

Are there any cardinals other than 
$\mathrm{card}(\mathbb{N})$ and 
$\mathrm{card}(\mathbb{R})$?

Are there any cardinals between

Implicit of axiom of choice (AOC) used to 'prove' 
well ordering (WO) of cardinals.
('Cardinals' not clearly defined.
Should it be equivalence classes of sets where
equivalence means 'there exists'/'we can construct'
a $\OneToOne$ mapping.)
\hfill\break
Well ordering used to show 'scale' of infinite cardinals
$\aleph_0, \aleph_1, \ldots$. (Is this countable?)
\hfill\break
Continuum hypothesis: 
$\mathfrak{c} = \mathrm{card}(2^{\mathbb{N}}) 
> \mathrm{card}(\mathbb{R}) = \aleph_1$
(and there are no cardinalities in between).

Zermelo axioms of set theory, including AC.
Start from axioms defining initial universe:

\item The formula $\neg P$ is defined as $P\Rightarrow \bot$,

\item There is no proof of $\bot$
(the absurdity, or bottom type

What is a 'function' here?

Analysis examples too detailed and lacking motivation

of intervals in $\mathbb{Q}$~\cite{Bridger:2019}.

Intermediate value theorem C: 
``If $f$ is a continuous real-valued mapping 
on the closed interval $[0,1]$ such that $f(0)⋅f(1)<0$, 
then there exists $x$ such that $0<x<1$ and $f(x)=0$.

Proof requirement: 
An algorithm which, applied to the function $f$, 
a modulus of continuity for $f$, and the values $f(0)$ and $f(1)$,
computes an object $x$ and shows that $x$ is a real number 
between $0$ and $1$; and
shows that $f(x)=0$.''~\cite{sep:mathematics_constructive}

Not constructive because it requires
``lesser limited principle of omniscience (LLPO)''.

Intermediate value theorem D:
``If $f$ is a continuous real-valued mapping 
on the closed interval $[0,1]$ 
such that $f(0)⋅f(1)<0$, 
then for each $\epsilon>0$ 
there exists $x$ such that $0<x<1$ and $|f(x)|<\epsilon$.

Can be proved constructively.

Stronger intermediate value thm:
``Let $f$ be a continuous real-valued mapping

Suppose also that $f$ is locally nonzero, 
in the sense that for each $x \in [0,1]$

there exists $y$ such that $|x−y|<r$ and $f(y) \neq 0$. 
Then there exists $x$ such that $0<x<1$ and $f(x)=0$.''

Section 3: Varieties

Section 3.1: Inuitionist (Brouwer)

``Brouwer was not the clearest expositor of his ideas, 
as is shown by the following quotation:

Mathematics arises when the subject of two-ness, 
which results from the passage of time, 
is abstracted from all special occurrences. 
The remaining empty form [the relation of n to n+1] 
of the common content of all these two-nesses 
becomes the original intuition of mathematics 
and repeated unlimitedly creates new mathematical subjects. 
(quoted in Kline [1972], 1199–2000)''

(Nederlands to Deutsch to English?)

``According to [Brouwer’s] view and reading of history, 
classical logic was abstracted 
from the mathematics of finite sets and their subsets. \ldots 
Forgetful of this limited origin, 
one afterwards mistook that logic 
for something above and prior to all mathematics, 
and finally applied it, without justification, 
to the mathematics of infinite sets. 
This is the Fall and original sin of set theory, 
for which it is justly punished by the antinomies. 
It is not that such contradictions showed up that is surprising,
 but that they showed up at such a late stage of the game. 
 (Weyl [1946])''
 
Weyl may have worked out a description of
$\mathbb{R}$ without (uncountable) infinity or
axiom of choice?

\label{sec:Martin_Lof_IEP}

``However he soon revisited foundations in a different way, 
which harks back to Russell's type theory, 
albeit using a more constructive and less logicist approach. 
The basic idea of Martin-Löf's theory of types (Martin-Löf, 1975) 
is
that mathematical objects all come as types, 
and are always given in terms of a
type (for example, one such type is that of functions 
from natural numbers to
natural numbers), due to an intuitive understanding 
that we have of the notion
of the given type.

The central distinction Martin-Löf makes is that 
between proof and derivation.
Derivations convince us of the truth of a statement, 
whereas a proof contains the data necessary for computational
(that is, mechanical) verification of a proposition. 
Thus what one finds in standard mathematical textbooks are
derivations; 
a proof is a kind of realizability (c.f. Kleene, 1945) and links
mathematics to implementation (at least implicitly).

The theory is very reminiscent of a kind of cumulative hierarchy. 
Propositions can be represented as types 
(a proposition's type is the type of its proofs),
and to each type one may associate a proposition 
(that the associated type is not empty). 
One then builds further types by construction on already existing
types.''

Usually drop law of excluded middle

so $P \vee \lnot P$ is not provable.

But keep law of non-contradiction

In other words, it is impossible to prove both.

Witnesses: Proving $\exists _{x\in \Set{X}}P(x)$ requires
constructing a specific $a \in \Set{X}$ such that $P(a)$ is true;
